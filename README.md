# Building_MS_Star

Project for PHYS375, Building a Main Sequence Star using given 5 differential equations 

Method for solving includes adapative bisection (integral boundary slices width change depending on the rate of change of the solved integral)

A Runge-Kutta 4 algorithim could also be used to solve these equations
